# Connect Four
    
    Connect Four is a basic logic that requires a player to get four of the same color in a row in order to beat the opposing player. 

    Connect Four is an all ages game and a great way to pass the time with a friend. I chose Connect Four because I used to dominate my sister as a child and wanted to give her a chance to practice before the holidays.
